Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.
By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—
to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)
You can apply it to your programs, too.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public,
the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file
to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
