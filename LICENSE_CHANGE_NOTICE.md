# Synapta OS License Transition Notice

**Date:** October 2025  
**Project:** Synapta OS  
**Maintainer:** David Arriaga

## Purpose of this Change

To guarantee that **Synapta OS remains a fully Free and Open-Source Operating System**, the project has officially adopted the **GNU General Public License (GPL v2 or later)** as its primary license.

This change ensures that every user and developer retains the fundamental freedoms of free software:
1. The freedom to **run** the program for any purpose.  
2. The freedom to **study** how the program works and adapt it to personal or institutional needs.  
3. The freedom to **redistribute** copies to help others.  
4. The freedom to **improve** the software and share improvements publicly.

## Adoption of the Linux Kernel and Compatibility Reasons

Synapta OS is built upon the **Linux 6.1 LTS kernel**, which is licensed under the **GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)**.  
Since the kernel forms the core of the operating system and defines its legal and technical framework, Fundación Synapta has decided to **adopt the same licensing model** to ensure **full compatibility and transparency**.

By aligning Synapta OS with the GPL family of licenses:
- The entire system—kernel, base, and user interface—shares a unified legal foundation.  
- There are **no conflicts** between the Linux kernel license, the Debian 12 sources, and Synapta’s own components.  
- Future integrations, drivers, and user-space tools can be distributed legally and safely under a consistent license.

## Why We Changed from MIT to GPL

The previous MIT License granted full permission for reuse but allowed third parties to **close or commercialize** the code without contributing back to the community.

By switching to the GPL, we ensure that:
- All versions of Synapta OS, whether modified or redistributed, must remain **open source**.  
- The system is **protected against proprietary locking**, DRM restrictions, and patent limitations.  
- The educational and scientific community can rely on Synapta OS as a platform that will **always remain free software**.  

This decision reflects our commitment to preserving **freedom, knowledge, and ethical software development**.

## Impact on Contributors and Users

- All new contributions to Synapta OS are accepted under **GPL v2 or later**.  
- All previously MIT-licensed components by Fundación Synapta are now re-licensed under the same GPL terms.  
- Debian and Linux components retain their **original GPL-compatible licenses**.  
- The entire distribution, including installers and ISO images, will identify Synapta OS as **GPL-licensed software**.

## Long-Term Vision

This transition strengthens Synapta OS as a truly open, ethical, and community-driven operating system.  
It aligns our project with the global free software movement and guarantees that our technology will always promote:

- Transparency  
- Collaboration  
- Knowledge sharing  
- Innovation with integrity  

By adopting the same license as the Linux kernel, Fundación Synapta ensures that Synapta OS remains **legally compatible, technically robust, and forever free** for education, research, and human development.
