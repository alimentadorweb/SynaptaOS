ü¶ú Parrot IA Interface

Parrot IA Interface is a Python + Uvicorn application that serves as a smart communication layer between users and Ollama AI models.
Developed as an integral component of Synapta OS, it provides a fast, secure, and low-latency way to interact with local or remote AI models through a clean, web-based interface.

Built with FastAPI and designed for modularity, Parrot IA enables seamless integration with Synapta OS Server and other Linux-based environments used in education, research, and edge computing. It allows users to deploy and interact with Ollama models‚Äîsuch as Tiny, LLaMA, or Mistral‚Äîwithout relying on external cloud infrastructure.
